# [My userscripts](https://hakorr.github.io/Userscripts/)

> *Clumsy and inelegant, they'll fall apart, but they'll work, and they'll keep working, as long as there's someone around to bodge them again if they break.* - **Tom Scott (The Art of the Bodge)**

**This is why I love userscripts! You shouldn't complain if they're not professionally made :)**
