# Telegram semi-automatic group mass DM sender

*We are not responsible for any issues such as damages or losses caused by the userscript.*

# Usage

1. Open a group chat with a member list visible. The group needs to have public members.
2. Write your message to the floating Väinämöinen window.
3. Start, then choose to send (ENTER) or to skip (SPACEBAR) the message.

Väinämöinen remembers the users it has visited, and will refuse to visit the same user twice. To send a "second wave" of messages to the same members, navigate to the "Debug" tab and click the "Clear Data" button.

**NOTE: Do not navigate the Telegram site yourself during this process. Do not spam keybinds or buttons.**
