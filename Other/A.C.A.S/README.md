## Developing

A.C.A.S takes advantage of GM storage, making a "CommLink" to enable communication between windows. The GUI and engine are both completely external and untouchable to the Chess page. This allows WASM multithreading, and fewer restrictions on Web Workers. The GUI and its files can be found [on the docs folder](../../docs/A.C.A.S). The docs folder allows for a short GUI URL.
